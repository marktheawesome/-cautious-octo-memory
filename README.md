## Welcome to my 2D platformer 

I made this game for my Computer programming class in high school. I am a junior at J.L. Mann in South Carolina. Thank you for playing my game.


### Background

I had attempted this project before, I was using [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/). However, when I tried to initialize the git repository, I was not paying attention and erased the whole project the day before it was due. After a good cry, curse words, and my new favorite vodka, [Ketel one](https://www.ketelone.com). This is a quick and dirty attempt to remake what I had. This time I will be using [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) to make it.


### Description

My original idea was to copy New Super Mario Bros. DS. With the unfortunate turn of events I had time to rethink my idea. However, I love that game so much that I am going to remake it anyways. Currently (5/30/2019) I am only going to make the first level of the first world. After making the first level the next ones should be easer and updates should come more often. Mario currently is only one size and has hearts in the corner to indicate health. I hope to get all sizes of Mario working soon.
