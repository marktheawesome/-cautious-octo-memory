## Welcome to my 2D platformer 

I made this game for my Computer programming class in high school. I am a junior at J.L. Mann in South Carolina. Thank you for playing my game.


### Background

I had attempted this project before, I was using [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/). However, when I tried to initialize the git repository, I was not paying attention and erased the whole project the day before it was due. After a good cry, curse words, and my new favorite vodka, [Ketel one](https://www.ketelone.com). This is a quick and dirty attempt to remake what I had. This time I will be using [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) to make it.


### Description

My game is based on New Super Mario Bros on the DS.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/marktheawesome/-cautious-octo-memory/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
